# Auto Merge Dependabot PRs

A Python script to automatically find and merge open Dependabot pull requests across all your personal repositories and repositories you have write access to. It merges only Dependabot PRs that have passed all required CI checks and are mergeable.

---

## Features

- Scans all repositories with write access for open Dependabot PRs.
- Checks that PRs are mergeable and have passing CI status checks.
- Supports three GitHub merge methods: `merge`, `squash`, and `rebase`.
- Dry-run mode to preview PRs that would be merged without actually merging.
- Option to exclude specific repositories from the scan.
- Handles GitHub API rate limits and errors gracefully.
- Logs actions and errors to a file `dependabot_automerge.log`.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [PyGithub](https://pypi.org/project/PyGithub/)

```bash
pip install PyGithub
````

* A GitHub personal access token with `repo` permissions.
  Create one at [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"
```

## Usage

Run the script with optional arguments:

```bash
python script.py [--merge-method {merge,squash,rebase}] [--dry-run] [--exclude-repos repo1 repo2 ...]
